              The last 20 years have been the hottest on record since 1980. The
              IPCC recently released a report warning that if global
              temperatures exceed 1.5 Degrees Celsius, climate change will
              become irreversible and the effects disastrous.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              To make a lasting change, companies need to act with more urgency
              and completely cut ties with the fossil fuel industry immediately.
              There is no more time to continue pushing these goals further
              away. If we do not achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,
              temperatures will exceed 1.5 degrees celsius, and the inevitable
              natural disasters that come will be catastrophic. 
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              One of the most impactful ways to cut emissions is renewable
              energy. Many companies have already begun investing in renewable
              energy resources and putting climate change at the forefront of
              their business. Banking companies are one of the most influential
              businesses with the ability to make powerful changes by what they
              choose to invest in. 
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              Since the Paris Agreement in 2016, $1.9 trillion has been invested
              in fossil fuels by 33 banks globally - more than all the money
              currently circulating across the entire U.S.
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              As individuals, we can help make a change by supporting banks that
              care about their societal and environmental impact. For
              sustainable change, companies need to invest in their communities
              and people too.{" "}
            </p>

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              We have put together a list of ethical and “green” banks that are
              aware of their impact and the change they can make. None of the
              banks listed donate to fossil fuel companies and all function with
              ethics and values at the core of their business.
