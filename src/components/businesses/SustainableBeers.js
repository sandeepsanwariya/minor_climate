                  Brooklyn Brewery has been implementing sustainable practices
                  since 1996 when they began reducing energy demand and switched
                  to wind energy for all their processes. Their sustainable
                  initiatives have continued to grow over the years, finding new
                  ways to save energy and reduce waste.  In 2016, they planted
                  375 acres of trees to offset 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide.
                  Their contribution offset the carbon emitted from their
                  Williamsburg operations, including the electricity and natural
                  gas used to produce the cases for their bottles and barrel
                  kegs.  Read more about their sustainability initiatives here!

                  In 1998, Alaskan Brewing became the first brewery in the U.S.
                  to install a system that captures and cleans the carbon
                  emitted from producing beer. They also implemented a mash
                  filter press in 2008 that allowed them to use less than
                  roughly 2 million gallons of water and 6% less malt to make
                  the same amount of beer.  Since there are no farms in Alaska,
                  they've been shipping their spent grain to farmers in the
                  Pacific Northwest for almost 20 years. In 2011, they developed
                  the first steam boiler fueled solely by spent grain and aimed
                  to reduce their oil consumption by more than 65% with this new
                  system. The Alaskan Brewing Company continues to look for new
                  and innovative ways to reduce its environmental impact.

                  Their impressive sustainability initiatives include water
                  conservation, composting all food waste produced at their
                  operations facility, using solar panels that generate 73% of
                  their power, and more. They also recycle the carbon dioxide
                  produced during fermentation by recovering, cleaning, and
                  returning it to the brewery to pressurize tanks and aid in
                  packing. Their Chico brewery was certified as a TRUE Zero

                  composting programs, which currently diverts 95% of their

                  Firestone Walker Brewery bases many of its sustainability
                  initiatives on the concept of "reuse, reduce, recycle." 100%
                  of their processed plastic, glass, aluminum, and cardboard are
                  recycled. They use a waste program that repurposes old
                  equipment into new items.  Firestone Walker installed 9.7
                  acres of solar panels as part of their commitment to clean and
                  renewable energy. They also established a water treatment
                  facility in 2015 and have recovered about 10,000 gallons of
                  wastewater per week. This year, they launched a new
                  sustainability initiative, Brewing for Tomorrow, encompassing
                  clean energy, water conservation, and waste elimination. Talk
                  about doing it all.

                  Hawaii's largest craft brewery, Maui Brewing, began running
                  more than 80% of its energy needs on renewable solar energy in
                  2019. Leading in sustainability has been one of their
                  priorities, and as the most sustainable brewery in Hawaii,
                  they're on track to doing so.  Other sustainability efforts
                  include capturing and reusing CO2. Together, solar and CO2
                  recovery will reduce emissions by more than 2 million pounds
                  per year.

                  For 10 Barrel Brewing, sustainable responsibility is at the
                  core of what they do. In 2019, 97.5% of their solid waste was
                  diverted from landfills by recycling, reusing, and reducing
                  plastic consumption.  Along with reducing their waste, they're
                  also looking for ways to conserve energy. 10 Barrel tracks
                  their energy consumption every month to record leaks or
                  overuse to prevent this in the future. They installed 1,026
                  solar panels, saving 365 metric tons annually. 10 Barrel's
                  future projects include transforming their Oregon locations to
                  100% renewable energy by November of this year. If you're ever
                  in the Oregon location, stop by and show your support!

                  Not every company can do everything, but every company can
                  do something. Golden Road Brewing was founded in 2011 in Los
                  Angeles with the goal to bring fresh beer in the most
                  sustainable way possible.  With their Heal the Bay IPA, Golen
                  Road Brewing donates a portion of the proceeds to Heal the
                  Bay, a local nonprofit dedicated to preserving the beaches and
                  watersheds of Southern California. Final Thoughts Who knew so
                  many breweries were leading the way in sustainable business
                  practices? With more companies adopting these methods, it's
                  getting easier to reduce your impact. Show these companies
                  your support by buying their beers, and cheers to a more
                  sustainable future!
